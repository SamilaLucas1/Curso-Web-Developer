                The birds have left their trees <br>
                The light pours onto me<br>
                I can feel you lying there, all on your own<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                We got here the hard way<br>
                All those words that we exchange<br>
                Is it any wonder things get broke?<br>

            <p>'Cause in my heart and in my head<br>
                I'll never take back the things I said<br>
                So high above, I feel it coming down<br>

        <p>I can't save us, my Atlantis, we fall<br>
            We built this town on shaky ground<br>

                Now all the birds have fled<br>
                The hurt just leaves me scared<br>
                Losing everything I've ever known<br>
                </p> 
                <p>
                    It's all become too much<br>
                    Maybe I'm not built for love<br>
                    If I knew that I could reach you, I would go<br>
